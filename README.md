# ARTI 308 – Lab 2

## Dataset Description
This project uses the Iris dataset, which contains **150 instances** of iris plants. Each instance has **4 numerical features**: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset includes **3 species of iris plants**: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. There are **no missing values** in the dataset.

## Machine Learning Problem
This is a **supervised classification problem**. The goal is to predict the species of an iris plant based on its sepal and petal measurements. The target variable is the iris species.
